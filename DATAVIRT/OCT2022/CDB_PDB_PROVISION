0. link CDB dSource, note: it creates snapshots of PDB and container database, here is the UI->Actions
output:
Run SnapSync for database "CDOMLOSR9CD5PDB1".
24s
Starting snapshot of pluggable database "CDOMLOSR9CD5PDB1" and container database "CDOMLOSR9CD5

------------------

1. disable LogSync within CDB->Configuration->Data Management
2. attempt to provision VDB VCDO_K95 from PDB whose parent container has logging disabled:
http://mk60150.dcol2.delphix.com/Server.html#/dataset/ORACLE_DB_CONTAINER-4/timeflow
no problems to report
3. linked a second PDB within parent container... no problems
not sure how to reproduce 

4. link physical CDB at target-end, disable LogSync, attempt to provision existing vPDB to the disabled
CDB and it will fail instantly generating a large error box.

blocks associated with data in masked VDB, using SDD there is masking:

https://docs.delphix.com/docs/configuration/capacity-and-resource-management/an-overview-of-held-space
The metadata objects relating to the dSource could contain sensitive information like hostnames, user names, and passwords. Hence they are not replicated to the Replication Target. The data belonging to the dSource is replicated after redacting any sensitive information. This redacted data shows up as held space

Reproduce: set hook to exit 0 with SDD and selecting "mask this VDB"
