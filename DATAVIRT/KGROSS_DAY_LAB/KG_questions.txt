1. the DXVIRT600 course states dSource snapshots are deleted eventually if there are no dependencies; Do we ever have customers asking for access to those deleted dSource snapshots?
2. Do we find the dSource of a VDB via mds_client query? I'm wondering how to associate which dSource is used for which VDB.
3.  restore customer environments from Support Bundle TOI.
4. Understand the endpoint, and the payload, this can be observed in JSON body of API calls within Support Bundle.
5. Understand our expected interoperability behaviors.
6. Learn containers, timeflows, zpool, snapSync, logSync, journalctl, where to collect data.
7. Can I look at any customer's console from dcol2?
8. Every container has a timeflow, and every container can have multiple timeflows. 
RMAN is used for incremental backups, we query for archive logs every 5 seconds.
-sense of urgency is sometimes self-inflicted, customer isn't down, take the time to learn something new; No rush!
-when you hit your technical limit, get someone else involved

9. initially I got stuck tryind to drill into HOST-USER-[1,2] from dlpx_host_environment. After driling around I found it within the dlpx_environment_user table

MK questions
1. What does Delphix consider to be a container?
2. How do you verify containers in mds_client? How about each container's direct timeflows.
dx_toolkit also
3. list hosts, environments, databases
4. hprof dox: https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/samples/hprof.html
